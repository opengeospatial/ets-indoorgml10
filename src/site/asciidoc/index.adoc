= IndoorGML 1.0 Conformance Test Suite

== Scope

This executable test suite (ETS) verifies the conformance of the implementation
under test (IUT) with respect to the set of relevant specifications depicted in
Figure 1. Conformance testing is a kind of "black box" testing that examines the
externally visible characteristics or behaviors of the IUT while disregarding
any implementation details.

Several conformance classes are defined in the principal specifications; the ones
listed below are covered by this test suite:

* Class A
   - List capabilities of conformance class A
* Class B
    - List capabilities of conformance class B

== Test requirements

The documents listed below stipulate requirements that must be satisfied by a 
conforming implementation.

1. http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0]
2. http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/[Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0, Fifth Edition]
3. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231)[RFC 7231] - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content

If any of the following preconditions are not satisfied then all tests in the
suite will be marked as skipped.

1. Precondition 1
2. Precondition 2

== Test suite structure

The test suite definition file (testng.xml) is located in the root package, 
`org.opengis.cite.indoorgml10`. A conformance class corresponds to a &lt;test&gt; element, each
of which includes a set of test classes that contain the actual test methods. 
The general structure of the test suite is shown in Table 1.

.Test suite structure
[cols="2,6a",options=header]
|===
|Conformance class
|Test classes

|Conformance Level 1
|org.opengis.cite.indoorgml10.level1.*

|Conformance Level 2
|org.opengis.cite.indoorgml10.level2.*

The Javadoc documentation provides more detailed information about the test 
methods that constitute the suite.

== Using the REST API

Using the REST API of the TEAM Engine requires some run arguments. These ate summarized in Table 2.
The _Obligation_ descriptor can have the following values: M (mandatory), O (optional), or C (conditional).

.Test run arguments
[cols="1,1,1,6",options=header]
|===
|Name
|Value domain
|Obligation
|Description

|iut
|URI
|M
|A URI that refers to the implementation under test or metadata about it. Ampersand ('&amp;') characters must be percent-encoded as '%26'.

|ics
|A comma-separated list of string values.
|O
|An implementation conformance statement that indicates which conformance classes or options are supported.
